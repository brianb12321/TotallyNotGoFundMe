# Totaly Not GoFundMe
A simple ASP.NET web application that allows users to
create events that people can pledge to. This program
was for my .NET II final project.

## Plans for Improvement
The core functionality of the site is working, there are a few aspects of the project
that needs refactoring or refinement.

- Add Validation when user enters an invalid eventId in a GET request.
- Add Unit Testing for testing business logic
- Implement a real transaction model using either Paypal or Stripe
